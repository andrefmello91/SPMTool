# SPMTool: Stringer-Panel Modeling Tool

**This project is work in progress, and it's not released yet.**

**SPMTool** is a plugin for AutoCAD (2020 - 2022) for analysis and design of reinforced concrete structures by the [Stringer-Panel Method](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:9ebcace7-f3d7-4ee0-93ff-cd157f4e5774).

The following libraries are used:

- [MathNet.Numerics](https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-numerics) for Linear Algebra operations;

- [Units.NET](https://github.com/angularsen/UnitsNet) for simple unit conversions;

- [Live Charts](https://github.com/Live-Charts/Live-Charts) for load-displacement plotting;

- [OnPlaneComponents](https://github.com/andrefmello91/On-Plane-Components) for stress and strain transformations;

- [Extensions](https://github.com/andrefmello91/Extensions) for some numeric extensions;

- [Material](https://github.com/andrefmello91/Material) for concrete and reinforcement constitutive models;

- [Reinforced Concrete Membrane](https://github.com/andrefmello91/Reinforced-Concrete-Membrane) for membrane calculations;

- [FEM-Analysis](https://github.com/andrefmello91/FEM-Analysis) for finite element calculations;

- [SPMElements](https://github.com/andrefmello91/SPMElements) as the implementation of the finite elements.
